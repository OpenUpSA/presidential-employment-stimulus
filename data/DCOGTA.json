  "paragraph": "In certain areas of infrastructure delivery, labour-intensive methods can enhance the job creation impact, while delivering the same quality of infrastructure outcomes. While there has long been policy support for labour-intensive methods, these are not always used in practice. Through the stimulus, the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agency (MISA) of DCOGTA is building the capacity of municipalities to utilise these methods. Fifteen municipalities have been targeted; others have asked to join the process. This component is only expected to deliver results against the employment target in the 2021/22 financial year, because of the contracting cycle for municipal infrastructure.",
