The pandemic has exacerbated South Africa’s pre-existing crises of poverty and unemployment.The Presidential Employment Stimulus seeks to confront this impact directly, as part of government’s broader economic recovery agenda. Its aim is to use direct public investment to support employment opportunities – starting right now.",
#     DTIC="The Global Business Services Sector has an impressive track record. Established in 2006/7 to provide offshore customer service delivery, the sector has built from a low base to achieve an average year-on-year export revenue growth of at least 20% since 2014.",
#     DBE="A key priority identified in the National Development Plan is the improvement of quality education, skills development, and innovation. One intervention that has seen some experimentation in South Africa, with significant potential to scale nationally, is the use of school assistants to strengthen the learning environment. An important rationale for school assistants is the need to support teachers in the classroom, freeing up time for teaching and providing additional support to learners to improve education outcomes.",
#     DSD="Livelihoods from the provision of Early Childhood Development services were severely disrupted by the pandemic, with providers facing challenges with re-opening. There are costs associated with doing so safely, and some parents can no longer afford to pay fees as a result of job losses.",

#     DPWI="In addition to structural skills shortages that were experienced prior to the pandemic, the management of facilities and completion of infrastructure projects has been further impacted by restrictions on the movement of people and limitations placed on completing infrastructure projects during the lockdown. As the economy re-opens, additional capacity is required to address the backlog so that service provision can be restored",
